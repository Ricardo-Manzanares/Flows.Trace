**App Registration in Azure or Entra ID**
---------------
The step-by-step guide for registering an application can be found at the following Microsoft documentation link:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app#register-an-application

Steps 1 through 6

Once the application is created, you must add the following permission: Power Automate
Flows.Manage.All

The steps to add this permission can be found in the following guide:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis#add-permissions-to-access-your-web-api

**PCF Configuration**
---------------

- Add the control to a form for any entity for which you want to obtain the executions of an associated record.

**_You need to associate a property of a String field (TextField), such as the Record Name field or another field from the entity, to configure the control (no updates are made to this field in the PCF)._**

**Considerations for the Custom API**
---------------

The custom API reviews all unmanaged cloud flows to validate whether the entity record where the PCF is configured is associated as a trigger or used in a CRUD operation in any of the actions of each flow.

To improve performance, by default the PCF sends the review filter for executions from the last hour. You can change the filter within the PCF, keeping in mind that it will take longer to obtain a response.
