**PCF Configuration**
---------------

- Add the control to a form for any entity for which you want to obtain the executions of an associated record.

**_You need to associate a property of a String field (TextField), such as the Record Name field or another field from the entity, to configure the control (no updates are made to this field in the PCF)._**

**Considerations for the Custom API**
---------------

The custom API reviews all unmanaged cloud flows to validate whether the entity record where the PCF is configured is associated as a trigger or used in a CRUD operation in any of the actions of each flow.

To improve performance, by default the PCF sends the review filter for executions from the last hour. You can change the filter within the PCF, keeping in mind that it will take longer to obtain a response.
